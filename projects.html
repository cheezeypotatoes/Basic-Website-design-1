        <h2><a href="calculator.html">JS Calculator</a></h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cheezeypotatoes/cheezeyCalculator">Github Repo</a></h3>
        <p>This is still in progress though mostly complete and partialy functional. I need to address being able to operate more than once before hitting equals. Also needs to be made to accept negative numbers. Probably need to work on the reactivness too, it doesn't look to hot on mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>JS Hangman</h2>
        <p>This is fully functional although not much to look at. The logic running the game took me some time to figure out. I would like to come back to this and make it much more visually attractive.</p>

        <h3>JS/JQuery Sketch Pad</h3>
        <p>Nifty little sketch pad I made. It's not without issues however. I need to address why some colors wont be over written. Probably just an issue of needing to remove the proper div calsses but none the lees I was happy to get it working as it is now.</p>
