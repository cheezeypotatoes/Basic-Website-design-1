        <h3><a href="#">JS Calculator</a></h3>
        <p>This is still in progress though mostly complete and partialy functional. I need to address being able to operate more than once before hitting equals. Also needs to be made to accept negative numbers.</p>

        <h3>JS Hangman</h3>
        <p>This is fully functional although not much to look at. The logic running the game took me some time to figure out. I would like to come back to this and make it much more visually attractive.</p>

        <h3>JS/JQuery Sketch Pad</h3>
        <p>Nifty little sketch pad I made. It's not without issues however. I need to address why some colors wont be over written. Probably just an issue of needing to remove the proper div calsses but none the lees I was happy to get it working as it is now.</p>
