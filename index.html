        Welcome, my name is Curt. I'm a home study web dev learner devoted to becoming a professional developer. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my website. Just what exactly is my website you might ask? My website is my sandbox to practice my development skills, to showcase what I have learned and to share my experience with others as I learn it. Follow me as I share and discuss current projects and blog about my experiences along the way on this journey.

        This is my nest cam. I plan on  getting an outdoor cam and poinjt it at the bird feeders and embed that on my site. For now my nest cam looks out the window to the back yard.
